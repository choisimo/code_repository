# .gitignore
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# Lines starting with # are comments.
#
# For a comprehensive guide on .gitignore, see the Git documentation.
#
# It's a good practice to start with a template from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore
# or https://github.com/github/gitignore and customize it for your project.
